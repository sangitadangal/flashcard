## Prerequisites

You need Flutter installed on your machine. If you don't have it:

### Install Flutter (macOS)

```bash
# Download Flutter SDK
cd ~/development
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable

# Add to PATH (add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"

# Verify installation
flutter doctor
```

For other platforms, see: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

## Run the App (3 Steps)

### 1. Navigate to Project

```bash
cd /Users/sangitadangal/claude-projects/flutter-projects/flashcard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Run the App

**Option A: iOS Simulator (macOS only)**
```bash
# Open simulator
open -a Simulator

# Run app
flutter run
```

**Option B: Chrome (All platforms)**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Option C: Android Emulator**
```bash
# List available emulators
flutter emulators

# Launch an emulator
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>

# Run app
flutter run
```

## Expected Output

When the app launches, you should see:

1. **Top Bar**: "NeetCode 150" with filter and progress icons
2. **Progress Bar**: Shows 0/5 questions mastered initially
3. **Flashcard**: Displays "Two Sum" question
4. **Bottom Controls**: Navigation arrows and star button

**Solution**:
```bash
# For iOS
open -a Simulator

# For Chrome
flutter run -d chrome

# For Android
flutter emulators --launch Pixel_5_API_33
```

### "Pod install failed" (iOS)

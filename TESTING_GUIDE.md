# Testing Guide for Flashcard App

## Issue Fixed: Card Flip Animation

### What Was Wrong
The card flip animation wasn't showing the back side properly because:
1. The 3D transform was creating a mirrored/reversed view
2. The animation state wasn't properly syncing with navigation

### What Was Fixed

**File Modified:** `lib/widgets/flashcard_widget.dart`

**Changes Made:**
1. Simplified the flip animation logic to use `Visibility` widget
2. Added proper state sync between animation controller and provider
3. Fixed the transform calculation to show content correctly on both sides

## Testing Checklist

After running `flutter run`, test these interactions:

### ✅ Basic Flip Animation
- [ ] **Tap the card** → Should flip smoothly to show solution side
- [ ] **Tap again** → Should flip back to question side
- [ ] **Front side shows:** Question title, difficulty badge, category, full question text
- [ ] **Back side shows:** Brute Force/Optimized tabs, complexity info, approach steps

### ✅ Solution View (Back Side)
- [ ] **Brute Force tab** → Orange background when selected
- [ ] **Optimized tab** → Green background when selected
- [ ] **Switch tabs** → Content updates correctly
- [ ] **View Code button** → Expands to show Python code
- [ ] **Hide Code button** → Collapses code section
- [ ] **Approach steps** → Numbered steps visible with colored circles
- [ ] **Complexity info** → Time and Space complexity displayed

### ✅ Navigation
- [ ] **Swipe left** → Go to next question (card resets to front)
- [ ] **Swipe right** → Go to previous question (card resets to front)
- [ ] **Tap left arrow** → Previous question
- [ ] **Tap right arrow** → Next question
- [ ] **Star button** → Toggles mastered status (empty ↔ filled)

### ✅ Text Visibility
- [ ] **Front side text** → All text readable, not mirrored
- [ ] **Back side text** → All text readable, not mirrored
- [ ] **Tab labels** → "Brute Force" and "Optimized" clearly visible
- [ ] **Step numbers** → 1, 2, 3, etc. visible in colored circles
- [ ] **Code** → Python code readable (not backwards)

### ✅ Filter & Progress
- [ ] **Tap filter icon** → Opens filter screen
- [ ] **Select difficulty** → Filters questions
- [ ] **Tap chart icon** → Opens progress screen
- [ ] **Mark as mastered** → Progress bar updates

## If You Still See Issues

### Issue: Text appears backwards or mirrored

**Solution:** The fix should have resolved this. If still happening:
```bash
# Hot restart the app
# Press 'R' in the terminal where flutter run is running
# Or restart:
flutter run
```

### Issue: Back side is blank/white

**Possible causes:**
1. Animation state issue
2. Provider not loading questions

**Debug steps:**
```bash
# Check console for errors
# You should see no errors related to questions loading

# Verify questions loaded
# Tap the card - if it animates but shows blank, check console
```

### Issue: Tap does nothing

**Possible causes:**
1. GestureDetector not working
2. Animation controller issue

**Debug steps:**
1. Try tapping in center of card
2. Check if swipe gestures work (swipe left/right)
3. If swipe works but tap doesn't, restart app

## Expected Behavior

### Front Side (Question)
```

## Performance Check

- **Animation smoothness:** Should be 60 FPS (smooth, no stuttering)
- **Tap responsiveness:** Immediate response to tap
- **Navigation speed:** Instant when swiping or tapping arrows
- **No lag:** UI should feel snappy

## All Questions Available

Test with all 5 questions:
1. Two Sum (Easy)
2. Valid Anagram (Easy)
3. Contains Duplicate (Easy)
4. Valid Palindrome (Easy)
5. 3Sum (Medium)

Each should flip properly and show complete solution information.

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Restart app
flutter run

# Hot reload (if you make code changes)
# Press 'r' in terminal

# Hot restart (reset app state)
# Press 'R' in terminal

# Check for errors
# Watch the terminal for any red error messages
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Card flips smoothly with 3D animation
✅ Front side shows complete question
✅ Back side shows solution with tabs
✅ All text is readable (not mirrored)
✅ Tabs switch between Brute Force and Optimized
✅ Code expands/collapses on button press
✅ Navigation resets card to front side
✅ Swipe gestures work correctly

If all these pass, the app is working correctly! 🎉

## Key Features Explained

### Multiple Sets Homepage
- App opens to set selection screen
- Shows available flashcard sets with progress
- Currently includes NeetCode 150
- Easy to add more sets (Blind 75, System Design, custom sets)
- Progress tracked independently per set

### Flashcard Interface
- **Front**: Question description with difficulty badge
- **Back**: Tabbed solutions (Brute Force / Optimized)
- Each solution includes:
  - Complete Python code (collapsible)
  - Time and space complexity
  - Detailed explanation
  - 5-7 step-by-step approach

### Progress Tracking
- Mark questions as mastered with star button
- Overall progress bar and percentage
- Progress breakdown by difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Progress breakdown by category
- Automatic persistence using SharedPreferences
- Data survives app restarts

### Filtering System
- Filter by difficulty (multiple selection)
- Filter by category (multiple selection)
- Combine filters for precise control
- Active filter indicator on home screen
- Shows filtered count (e.g., "Showing 25 of 150")

## Usage

### Navigation
- **Tap card** to flip between question and solution
- **Swipe left/right** to navigate questions
- **Previous/Next buttons** for precise control
- **Star button** to mark as mastered

### Filtering
1. Tap filter icon (top-right)
2. Select difficulties and/or categories
3. Apply multiple filters simultaneously
4. Tap "Clear All" to reset

### Progress
1. Tap chart icon (top-right)
2. View overall progress circle
3. See breakdown by difficulty and category
4. Reset progress with confirmation

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.0+
- **Language**: Dart
- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **Storage**: SharedPreferences (JSON)
- **Animation**: Custom 3D Matrix4 transforms
- **Architecture**: Clean separation (Models/Services/Screens/Widgets)

## Dependencies

```yaml
provider: ^6.1.1          # State management
shared_preferences: ^2.2.2 # Persistent storage
flutter_lints: ^3.0.0     # Code quality
```

## Building for Release

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Web
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

## Data Version Control

The app includes automatic version control for the question dataset:

- **Version 1**: 5 sample questions
- **Version 2**: Full 150 questions (current)

When upgrading, the app automatically:
- Detects old cached data
- Loads new dataset
- Preserves user progress for matching questions
- Updates version number

## Adding New Questions

To add more questions, create or edit category files in `lib/models/categories/`:

```dart
final question = LeetCodeQuestion(
  id: 151,
  title: "Your Question",
  difficulty: Difficulty.medium,
  category: "Your Category",
  question: """Problem description...""",
  bruteForce: Solution(
    code: """Python code""",
    timeComplexity: "O(n)",
    spaceComplexity: "O(1)",
    explanation: "Explanation",
    steps: ["Step 1", "Step 2", ...],
  ),
  optimized: Solution(...),
);
```

Then add to `lib/models/all_questions.dart`.

## Adding New Flashcard Sets

Edit `lib/models/available_sets.dart`:

```dart
FlashcardSet(
  id: 'blind_75',
  title: 'Blind 75',
  description: 'The famous 75 LeetCode questions',
  iconEmoji: 'ðŸŽ¯',
  totalQuestions: 75,
  questions: blind75Questions,
  category: 'Coding Interview',
),
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dependencies not installing
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Issue: App not launching
```bash
flutter doctor  # Check setup
flutter run -v  # Verbose output
```

### Issue: Progress not saving
- Check storage permissions
- Verify SharedPreferences is working
- Try uninstall/reinstall

### Issue: Wrong question count
- Uninstall app to clear cache
- Reinstall to load fresh data

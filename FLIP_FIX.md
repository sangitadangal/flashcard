# Fix: Flashcard Flip Animation Issue

## Problem Report
- **Issue**: Card flip not working - back side (answer) not visible when tapping card
- **Device**: iOS Simulator
- **Symptoms**: Tapping card had no visible effect, answer side didn't appear

## Root Cause

The 3D flip animation had two issues:

1. **Transform Logic Error**: The original code used nested transforms that caused the back side to render mirrored/reversed:
   ```dart
   // OLD (broken)
   child: angle >= pi / 2
       ? Transform(
           transform: Matrix4.identity()..rotateY(pi),
           child: _buildBackSide(question),
         )
       : _buildFrontSide(question),
   ```

2. **State Sync Issue**: Animation state wasn't properly reset when navigating between questions

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Transform Logic

**Changed:** Used `Visibility` widget with proper transform for back side

```dart
// NEW (fixed)
child: Visibility(
  visible: isFront,
  replacement: Transform(
    transform: Matrix4.rotationY(pi),
    alignment: Alignment.center,
    child: _buildBackSide(question),
  ),
  child: _buildFrontSide(question),
),
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Front side shows correctly during first half of animation (0° to 90°)
- ✅ Back side shows correctly during second half (90° to 180°)
- ✅ No mirrored/reversed text
- ✅ Proper visibility toggling

### 2. Fixed State Management

**Added:** Proper state sync between animation and provider

```dart
// Reset animation when showing front side
if (!provider.isShowingAnswer && _controller.value > 0) {
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    _controller.reset();
  });
}
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Card resets to front when navigating to new question
- ✅ Animation state syncs with provider state
- ✅ No stuck animations

## Files Modified

- **lib/widgets/flashcard_widget.dart**
  - Lines 76-101: Fixed flip animation logic
  - Lines 62-67: Added state sync for navigation

## Testing

To test the fix:

```bash
# If app is running, hot restart
# Press 'R' in terminal

# Or restart completely
flutter run
```

Then verify:
1. ✅ Tap card → Flips to show solution
2. ✅ Tap again → Flips back to question
3. ✅ All text readable (not mirrored)
4. ✅ Tabs work (Brute Force / Optimized)
5. ✅ Swipe navigation resets card to front

## Technical Details

### Animation Flow

**Before (Broken):**
```
Tap → Animation starts → Angle increases
→ At 90°: Nested Transform applied
→ Text appears mirrored ❌
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
Tap → Animation starts → Angle increases
→ At 50%: Visibility switches sides
→ Back side pre-rotated 180° to counter rotation
→ Text appears normal ✅
```

### Key Changes

1. **Removed nested Transform**: No longer applying double rotation
2. **Used Visibility**: Clean switch between front/back at midpoint
3. **Pre-rotated back side**: Counter-rotation prevents mirroring
4. **Added state callback**: Ensures animation resets on navigation

## Verification

Run through the testing checklist in `TESTING_GUIDE.md` to verify all functionality works correctly.

## Status: FIXED ✅

The card flip animation now works correctly on iOS simulator and should work identically on physical iPhone devices.

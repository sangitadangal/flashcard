## 🔍 How Data Loading Works

### First Launch (New Install)
1. App checks SharedPreferences for cached data
2. No cached data found → loads all 150 questions
3. Saves questions with version = 2
4. Ready to use!

### Subsequent Launches
1. App checks SharedPreferences for cached data
2. Finds data with version = 2
3. Loads cached data (includes your progress)
4. Fast startup!

### Upgrade from Old Version
1. App finds cached data with version = 1 (or no version)
2. Detects version mismatch
3. Loads fresh 150 questions
4. Updates version to 2
5. Saves new dataset
6. Preserves mastered status for matching questions

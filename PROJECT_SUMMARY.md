## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter 3.0+
- **Language**: Dart
- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **Storage**: SharedPreferences (local JSON storage)
- **UI**: Material Design 3
- **Animation**: Custom Matrix4 3D transforms

## Architecture

**Pattern**: Clean Architecture with separation of concerns

- **Models**: Pure data classes with JSON serialization
- **Services**: Business logic and state management
- **Screens**: Full-page views
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
1. Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Verify: `flutter doctor`

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/sangitadangal/claude-projects/flutter-projects/flashcard
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

See QUICK_START.md for detailed instructions.

## Differences from iOS Version

| Feature | iOS (SwiftUI) | Flutter |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Language | Swift 5.0 | Dart 3.0 |
| Framework | SwiftUI | Flutter |
| State Mgmt | @Published/@ObservedObject | Provider |
| Storage | UserDefaults | SharedPreferences |
| Platform | iOS only | iOS, Android, Web, Desktop |
| File Issues | ❌ Xcode recognition problems | ✅ No issues |
| Build System | Xcode | Flutter CLI |
| Hot Reload | Limited | Full support |

## Advantages of Flutter Version

1. **Cross-platform**: Works on iOS, Android, Web, macOS, Windows, Linux
2. **No Xcode issues**: Pure Dart project, no file recognition problems
3. **Better hot reload**: Instant updates during development
4. **Easier setup**: `flutter run` vs manual Xcode project configuration
5. **Consistent UI**: Same look across all platforms
6. **Better tooling**: Flutter DevTools for debugging

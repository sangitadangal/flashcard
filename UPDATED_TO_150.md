# ‚úÖ Updated to Full 150 Questions Dataset

## What Changed

The app has been updated to use the complete NeetCode 150 dataset instead of the 5 sample questions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Data Source
- **Before**: Used `sampleQuestions` (5 questions)
- **After**: Uses `allNeetCode150Questions` (150 questions)

### 2. Added Version Control
Added a version check in `flashcard_provider.dart` to ensure the app loads fresh data when the dataset changes:

```dart
const int currentVersion = 2; // Version 2 = 150 questions
```

The app will automatically:
- Detect old cached data (5 questions from version 1)
- Load the new 150 questions
- Save the updated dataset with version 2
- Preserve user progress (mastered status)

### 3. Files Modified

- `lib/services/flashcard_provider.dart` - Added version control logic
- `lib/models/all_questions.dart` - Created (imports all categories)

## How to Verify

### Method 1: Check the Progress Counter
1. Launch the app
2. Look at the top of the home screen
3. You should see: **"Progress: 0 / 150"** (or your mastered count / 150)

### Method 2: Check Categories
1. Tap the filter icon (top right)
2. Scroll through categories - you should see all 18 categories:
   - Arrays & Hashing (9)
   - Two Pointers (5)
   - Sliding Window (6)
   - Stack (7)
   - Binary Search (7)
   - Linked List (11)
   - Trees (15)
   - Tries (3)
   - Heap/Priority Queue (7)
   - Backtracking (9)
   - Graphs (13)
   - Advanced Graphs (6)
   - 1-D Dynamic Programming (12)
   - 2-D Dynamic Programming (11)
   - **Greedy (8)** ‚Üê NEW
   - **Intervals (6)** ‚Üê NEW
   - **Math & Geometry (8)** ‚Üê NEW
   - **Bit Manipulation (7)** ‚Üê NEW

### Method 3: Check Progress Screen
1. Tap the chart icon (top right)
2. View category breakdown
3. Should show all 18 categories with question counts

### Method 4: Navigate Through Questions
1. Swipe through flashcards
2. You can now navigate through 150 questions instead of 5

## Important Notes

### First Launch After Update
- The app will detect the old 5-question dataset
- It will automatically load all 150 questions
- This happens on the first launch after the update
- Your mastered progress for the original 5 questions is preserved

### Clear Data (If Needed)
If you encounter issues, you can force reload by:

**iOS Simulator:**
```bash
# Delete app and reinstall
# Or reset content and settings in simulator
```

**Physical Device:**
```bash
# Uninstall and reinstall the app
```

## Running the Updated App

```bash
cd /Users/sangitadangal/claude-projects/flutter-projects/flashcard

# Clean build (recommended)
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run on simulator
flutter run

# Or build release
flutter build ios --release
```

## What to Expect

### Before Update:
- Total: 5 questions
- Categories: 3 (Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers)
- Can only navigate through 5 cards

### After Update:
- Total: **150 questions** ‚úÖ
- Categories: **18 categories** ‚úÖ
- Navigate through all 150 cards ‚úÖ
- New categories available ‚úÖ

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Launch app and see "Progress: X / 150" at top
- [ ] Open filter screen - see all 18 categories
- [ ] Select "Greedy" category - see 8 questions
- [ ] Select "Bit Manipulation" - see 7 questions
- [ ] Swipe through multiple questions (should go beyond 5)
- [ ] Check progress screen - shows breakdown of all categories
- [ ] Mark a question as mastered - progress updates
- [ ] Close and reopen app - data persists
- [ ] Filter by difficulty - works across all 150
- [ ] Filter by multiple categories - works correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still showing only 5 questions

**Solution 1: Force reload**
1. Uninstall the app completely
2. Reinstall from the new build
3. Should load 150 questions on first launch

**Solution 2: Check logs**
1. Run `flutter run` from terminal
2. Look for debug output: "Error loading questions"
3. Check if `allNeetCode150Questions` is being loaded

**Solution 3: Verify build**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Problem: App crashes on launch

Check if all category files exist:
```bash
ls -la lib/models/categories/
```

Should show:
- greedy.dart
- intervals.dart  
- math_geometry.dart
- bit_manipulation.dart
- (plus 14 other category files)
